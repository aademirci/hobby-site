        <h2>Barefoot at Warsaw Airport</h2>

            Writing this from the NS train in the Netherlands: My first barefoot flight has just been accomplished. And 
            yesterday I achieved going to a stadium concert barefoot. It was Depeche Mode. Not my style, and a barefoot 
            heavy metal concert is still yet to be achieved. But two achievements in two consecutive days are enough for 
            a while I think. Now back to the routineâ€¦
