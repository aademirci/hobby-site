        <h2>About this diary</h2>

        <p>
            I have been enjoying a barefoot <strong>lifestyle</strong> for a 
            decade and I take a snapshot of the moment by adding entries to 
            this diary. These entries are made of 3 essential things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a top-down photo which documents that I am really barefoot</li>
            <li>a photo of what I see in front of me</li>
            <li>and a descriptive text for the moment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Adding entries to this diary creates a collection of happy moments 
            for me to return at any time because I feel <em>happy and free</em> 
            when I just be barefoot outside, no matter whether I am walking or 
            running. Yes, I ran a few 10k's without shoes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are of course times that I cannot be simply barefoot, so I 
            switched my footwear closet completely to the minimalist shoes and 
            sandals. These have thin and flexible soles with zero drop from heel 
            to toe, and each has a wide toe box as well.
