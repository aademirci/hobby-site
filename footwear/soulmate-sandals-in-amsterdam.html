            Hello with my new sandals made by Soulmate Sandals in Istanbul. This is my first huarache-style sandals and they 
            are a bit controversial within the family but I am getting used to them in terms of liking the looks. It is more 
            comfortable compared to my Exodus Sandals as there is a layer that absorb the rain and sweat, so it doesnâ€™t slip. 
            But I miss the ground feel of my good old sandals as this pair is brand new. Now there are options for my daily 
            fashion!
